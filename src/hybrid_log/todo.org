1. [] Build a single process POC that uses async queues to orgranize the components.
2. [] Build an mp version that uses mp.Queues
3. [] Build an extension of the mp version that uses shared memory for the write block transfers
   and queues to syncronize

Research

1. Try an mp test where writes go to one process and reads come from another, using sqlite.
2. Write a prototype that has the full api, a lmdb and a sqlite instance, does pause and
   snapshot manually, all in the same process with no queues or nothing. Kind of a POC
   for how the integration should work.
